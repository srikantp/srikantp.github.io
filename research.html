<h2> NOTA: a strategic choice with a positive impact on Indian elections</h2>
<p> Raghav Kumar, Sudarsan Padmanabhan and P. Srikant
<br> Asian Journal of Political Science 2023; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02185377.2023.2265372">link</a></p>
<p>We study how the introduction of a None of the Above (NOTA) option in Indian elections since 2013 has affected 
voting patterns and election outcomes. First, we examine the relationship between position on the ballot with electoral
outcomes by constructing a simple statistic that measures relative performance by position on the ballot or Electronic 
Voting Machines. Within non-party options, we show that the last option on the EVM ends up being a salient choice, which 
is an inversion of the usual findings in the literature on order effects, where earlier options are generally preferred. 
Second, the NOTA option is the salient choice for voters who choose not to vote for a party, and thereby substituting for 
independent candidates. This share is more than can be explained by ballot position alone. We argue that the existence of 
a NOTA option is not merely a procedural technicality; instead, voters use NOTA as a strategic option to express their 
protest.</p>
	
	  
<h2> Contracting Outcomes with Communication and Learning </h2>

<br> Studies in Microeconomics, Volume 8 Issue 1, June 2020;  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2321022219870644">link</a></p>
<p>We show that allowing communication can increase optimal choices and efficiency in a multitask, incomplete contracting, 
principalâ€“agent setting. We study two simple communication protocols, one allowing for one or more requests on 
non-contractible choices, and the other allowing for a request, promise and ex post payment. The protocol where principals 
are asked to communicate requests to the agent regarding non-contractible choices promotes better learning of optimal 
strategies on the part of the principals, but shows no tendency for coordination to superior outcomes. The benefits accrue 
mainly due to changes in the choices of principals, who issue communication, rather than those of agents. Coordination is 
promoted, and learning subdued, when the protocol permits promises and ex post payments, in addition to allowing a request. 
This protocol also increases efficiency, with the efficiency gains equal across the protocols.

<h2> Persistent Sunk Cost Fallacy in a Real Effort Experiment </h2>
<p>Priyodorshi Banerjee, S. Chandrasekhar, and P. Srikant 
<br> Studies in Microeconomics, Volume 2 Issue 1, June 2019;  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2321022219851593">link</a></p> 
<p>Subjects chose whether to leave with an endowment or stay to perform some simple tasks in a real effort experiment. 
In addition to performance pay, staying subjects received their endowment in the control condition, but had to sacrifice it in the treatment 
condition. We found average performance of staying subjects, after controlling for selection effects, was higher in the treatment condition. 
Further, the sunk cost effect persisted well after the decision as to whether to stay or leave had been made.

<h2> Learning to Set the Reserve Price Optimally in Laboratory First Price Auctions</h2>
<p>  Priyodorshi Banerjee, Shashwat Khare, and P. Srikant
<br> Games 2018, 9(4), 79;  <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/g9040079">link</a></p> 
<p>We analyze choices of sellers, each setting a reserve price in a laboratory first price auction with automated equilibrium bidding. 
Subjects are allowed to gain experience for a fixed period of time prior to making a single payoff-relevant choice. Behavior of more experienced 
sellers was consistent with benchmark theory: average reserve price for these sellers was independent of the number of bidders and equaled the 
predicted level. Less experienced sellers however deviated from the theoretical benchmark: on average, they tended to shade reserve price below 
the predicted level and positively relate it to the number of bidders.
