<p>I employ a mix of economics, mathematics, statistics and programming to solve real-world problems. I have been fortunate to work on a range of intellectually challenging assignments, including 
	designing <a href ="games"> auctions, games, quiz shows and experiments </a>, and in <a href ="games"> finance </a>.
</p>
	  
 <p>I have degrees in computer engineering and management, and a PhD in Finance. I have also managed large proprietary trading books employing systematic, quantitative and arbitrage strategies.
